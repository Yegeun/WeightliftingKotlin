This Project will not work anymore as the Firebase database permissions have now expired and I've now closed the account. But the app should still work if it is connected to a new firebase database which should be quite easy to do. 

# Features include

Distinct Screens, Rotation of Screens, Use of permissions, Create and use content, Use Shared preferences, Use Firebase for storing and retrieving data,
Recieve Broadcast events, Extend and use the exisiting view class. Implement and use the share action provider, Use Alarm manager and Use notifications.
